Task

Code should populate a question with a timer set for 20 seconds. (Time is set short as I still have not gotten the code to fully work).

Code should run through for loop for each question and then allow for answer to be selected and check the answer.

If answer is correct, correct count increases by one.  

While answer is being checked, game clock should pause.

I did not complete styling of the code as I am still trying to get the full code to work.

If the user is wrong, 2 seconds will be deducted from the game clock. 

Once the game is over, user should be prompted to add their name to the high score list.

I did not get the functionality of the high score.

I did not create a seperate high scores page.
